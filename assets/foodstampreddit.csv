Don't.  Just... don't.   It's illegal for good reason,  doing so can wind up getting you actual serious prison time, or a lifetime ban from receiving public assistance,  or both. Fraud is going to be a major topic in the coming months after the pandemic floodgates are closed,  and I am guessing that states will be tasked with pursuing it.

This sub has, and has always had, a **zero-tolerance policy on this issue**. It is literally the only thing we ban for every time if you're not a bot."
1,Rant - Please be kind to your worker,34,gtbxyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/gtbxyu/rant_please_be_kind_to_your_worker/,21,1590862175,"I’m a TANF/SNAP worker, meaning I give out cash aid and food stamps. I want to grant/authorize your case. I’d love to be able to load benefits on to your card today so you can go to the grocery store or pay your rent. But sometimes I can’t. We have to adhere to the federal rules and regulations. If you have not turned in all the necessary documents, I cannot do anything to “turn on your case” without being called in by Program Integrity. So please don’t yell at me because “I’m not helping you.” 

“So if I turn it in today, will I get it today?” Ordinarily I would tell you yes, but we have been INUNDATED with new cases. I cannot promise you I’ll get back to your case today. I explain to people, “I process paperwork in the order in which it is received. So if 10 people turn in paperwork before you, then yours is the 11th case I work on.” Do NOT respond to me by yelling about how long you’ve waited for an appointment. That is beyond my control. Ordinarily in my office we have 18 intake workers. Today we had 6. It’s not my fault we can no longer do 72 appts a day. Today we are doing 24, because you cannot force 6 people to do 18 people’s worth of work. (The Union had to step in because us 6 were doing 18 people’s worth of work.)

I’m your intake worker, I approve or deny your case. State guidelines say I have 45 days to approve/deny your case. Do you really think YELLING at me is going to push your case to the top of the pile?"

Note that it's higher than SNAP maximum benefit charts you may have seen because there is also a temporary 15% short-term increase to all SNAP benefits that is now extended through at least September and (as per the bill) should remain in place ""for as long as needed based on economic conditions"".

We're seeing lots of questions on this category, and this is a general ""You Should Know"" rather than state-specific. It is important to remember that states apply for waivers from the feds, and those can get approved or denied depending.

*  Raising the floor and ceiling - My understanding is that the new omnibus spending bill raised both minimum and maximum allotment amounts for all households through June 30 2021.

*  Pandemic supplemental - Independently of the raise in amounts,  states are asking for on a month-to-month basis to issue up to the max amount. January amounts have been announced for some states as of this morning,  but that's being slower than it has been.  Refer back to your state agency on this - we may know here, or we may not. 

*  Automatic recertifications - some states are auto-renewing households for another six months.

*  No-interview waivers - Some states have been approved for processing applications without interviews. Check with your local agency when you apply on this."

I am seventy years of age,  retired with Social Security income only.  I live alone in my paid off home in Seattle, Wa.  

That happens to provide me with a $16/month benefit.  Is that worth applying for?

Yes.  For April and May my benefit goes up to about $170  because the SNAP benefit is temporarily increasing to the maximum regardless of income because of the virus.

The City of Seattle owns it's own electric utility service,  and discounts the cost of electric service for me by about 50% because I qualify for SNAP benefits.  That's true for the city's water,  sewer and garbage utility service as well.

The city also has an extra charge for auto license tabs that I get discounted by $20/year because of SNAP benefits.

COMCAST provides me with internet service for $10/month because of special rates for SNAP participants negotiated by the City of Seattle 

A year ago in January I signed up for training as a CNC machinist with a local college because of the critical shortage of machinists driven by the Boeing company and the booming economy.  The $1700 cost per quarter for three quarters was paid by the State of Washington because I qualified for SNAP benefits.

I completed that training,  but unfortunately the shutdown of 737 MAX production and now the virus has meant I haven't found the job I had anticipated  ----which would have got me off of SNAP benefits.

There may be other discounts I'm not aware of because I have SNAP benefits.

Even a small SNAP benefit may pay off with surprisingly large results."

**Edit 2**: as suspected, the number of states has changed. Look for this trend to continue,  as it's evident the feds are updating one state at a time. 

**Edit 3 for June 2021**:  Due to guidance from the feds, if you have a *calculated benefit amount* of **$0**, you will no longer be receiving any additional EA benefits. This likely means that you've been receiving the max like everyone else and will now get nothing. I suggest calling your elected representatives in DC if you're exercised about this,  as IMO it's kind of a shitty thing to do to people.

Understandably, we're getting a lot of questions about this topic at the moment - this thread is intended to stem the tide a bit, so please keep commentary and questions on this topic here for the time being.

**What we know**:  ~~As of 4/6~~ Per the federal [Food & Nutrition Services page](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/covid-19-emergency-allotments-guidance), ~~16~~ many states have been approved for the Emergency Allotment waiver.  I will hazard a guess that there are more in the pipeline, but because these waivers are granted at the state's request on a monthly basis, this is obviously subject to change on a state-by-state basis.

[Guidance from FNS as of 4/1/21](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/snap-covid-emergency-allotments-phase-3-guidance.pdf) indicates that FNS is expanding benefits for those states still in an emergency status to increase allotments up to $95/mo, for those households that have received less than a $95/mo increase from the Emergency Allotment waiver thus far.

Because these changes will require additional updating of the data systems used to support SNAP issuance, it is possible, even likely, that some delays in the timing of these benefit implementation dates will occur.  Again, because this is managed at the local agency level, what state or county you live in will be highly relevant in answering those questions - please understand that agencies are getting this information at nearly the same time that the public is being informed...so they may or may not have answers in the moment.

I own my home with no mortgage,  which is a big benefit for me.

I was awarded a $15/month SNAP benefit.  So how far does that go?

Well,  Seattle charges an arm and a leg for water,  sewer and garbage service,  and charges a lot for car license tabs as well.  However,  since I am on SNAP,  I get a discount of about half on my WS&G bill and a rebate of $20/year on renewing license tabs.  I get internet service from COMCAST for $10/month as negotiated with Seattle.

I already get bus fares reduced from #2.75 to $1.00 as a senior,  but if I didn't SNAP benefits would get me a similar cheap fare.

I visit the local food bank once a week,  which provides a lot of food.

I also dumpster dive a couple of nearby grocery stores.  One provides me with more meat than I can eat  (that included a rib eye steak and a whole ham I'm still eating off of a couple of weeks ago).  The other provides me with far more fresh fruits and vegetables than I can eat.  I usually pick out ten pounds of oranges and a bunch of lemons and limes to squeeze on my  Mixmaster Model 12 mixer with the citrus squeezer attachment I have.

In January, 2019 I signed up for a CNC Machining Class offered at a nearby college.  I completed the three quarter certificate program there at the end of the summer,  with the State of Washington picking up the $1800/quarter tuition costs  because I'm on SNAP.

34,What Does the New Food Stamp Rule About Work Requirements Mean for the Program?,17,e6rc8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/e6rc8k/what_does_the_new_food_stamp_rule_about_work/,20,1575624490,"Hey everyone,

You've likely heard that there's a new final rule regarding work requirements for the food stamp program that is slated to go into effect in April 2020. I'm here to tell you what that means for the program.

First, here's [the USDA's press release on the rule](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fr-120419). 

**What the rule changes**

Some food stamp participants (able bodied adults without dependents) must work 20 hours/week to receive benefits. States have been able to waive the work requirement in areas (e.g. regions, counties) for reasons like high unemployment. This helps people stay on the program during economic downturns. During the recession, every state but one waived work requirements in at least part of the state. 

The new rule:

1. Only allows states to waive work requirements if unemployment is at least 6%, *and* is 20% higher than the national average. This is a higher standard than before.

2. No longer allows states to waive the work requirement based on the number of people receiving unemployment benefits. States must rely on historical unemployment data, which can take a little longer to acquire. 

**Who the rule affects**

Anti-poverty groups estimate that about [700,000 people will lose program benefits](https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/new-snap-rule-would-cost-many-of-nations-poorest-their-food-aid) because of the new changes (some areas will no longer be eligible for the waiver, and so the work requirements will kick that many people off the program). The USDA estimates that this will save about $1 billion per year (the program currently costs about $65 billion annually). 

**What happens now**

As I mentioned, the rule is slated to go into effect in April 2020. What's likely, however, is that the USDA will be sued by anti-poverty organizations, which will delay rule implementation while the courts determine whether the rule is legal. 

We recommend checking back in March 2020 to see whether the rule will go into effect. If it does, and you're in an area with waived work requirements, check with your state agency to determine whether you'll be affected by the change. 

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you!"

~~I'm speculating without any direct guidance from FNS, but based on what we saw recently, here's what I believe the end of the government shutdown means for the program for the next few months~~:

EDIT 1/28/19 @ 4:30 EST: I was able to confirm via FNS that the following information is true. FNS is also concerned about the 40+ lag in benefits for some participants and is weighing possible options.

EDIT 1/31/19 @ 9:30 EST: Q&A from FNS: https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/snap/SNAPFacts1-29-19.pdf

* The three week continuing resolution (CR) ends on February 15

* All February benefits are guaranteed (ongoing cases should have received theirs as early issuance in January-- **HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVED EARLY ISSUANCE WILL NOT RECEIVE MORE BENEFITS IN FEBRUARY WITHOUT SOME SORT OF FNS INTERVENTION**)

* This means that any financial obligations owed by the government (such as food stamp benefits and admin dollars) can be paid out for the 30 days following the (CR), or until **March 17, 2019**

* Therefore, March food stamp benefits should be guaranteed and paid out as normal

* ~~If there is *another* government shutdown following this CR, then April benefits could be paid out by March 15 as early issuance~~ Another shutdown was averted and an appropriations bill was passed that is good through the rest of the federal fiscal year (until October 2019).

**Upshot** ~~I believe FNS will confirm next week that~~ March/April benefits will be guaranteed for ongoing cases and recertifications that are processed before March 15"

38,Venting. Roommate lied on his snap application & did fraud and now uses all his ebt to buy soda and red bull..,16,icv19y,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/icv19y/venting_roommate_lied_on_his_snap_application_did/,26,1597895671,"My roommate who never once paid rent as agreed (can't evict yet due to covid law!) got food stamps about 3 weeks ago.  He lied on his application.  He told them that he was making his own food and buying it separately so that his app wouldn't be based on his other roommates' wages. If he used our info on the application, he'd have been denied.  He marked down that for the past 6 months he's been buying his own food.  Thus,  he got retro pay.  It was a lie. 

 He never once cooked or bought food. My other roommates and I fed him 3 meals per day, plus snacks and drinks. He never once bothered to help cook or clean after eating. 

I told him 3 weeks ago that he needs to contact our county's welfare board and explain that he will not be using the retro pay,  as it's illegal, but that he could still use future SNAP, as long as he didn't share food with us.  He had replied that he doesn't care if he goes to jail. I explained that he put me in a bad spot! He only thinks of himself.   How about the fact that now I have this weighing on my mind that he was stealing from those who needed it??? And that he got retro pay that he banked off of, when the ""retro"" reality was actually all my money spent on him?!

So,  I reported him to SNAP.  I don't really feel bad. I even warned him that I would be reporting him if he didn't comply.  He knew he was making me feel uncomfortable.  He also isn't starving.  He spent all the back pay on convenience-store-purchased Red Bull and a TON of soda. I'm talking about $35 a day just on soda.    Granted, he did buy a few Banquet frozen dinners. The bulk was candy bars.  That's what he's eating all day.   

How is it even legal that he can buy nothing but Red Bull and soda?  He's clearly taking advantage of the system.  How are there not ""caps"" on certain items? Surely,  one does not need 3 cans of Red Bull per day.  That's also bad on his heart. And $10/ day on nonsense.  I understand you may think it's none of my business what he spends his EBT money on,  but it sort of is.   Regardless,  the SNAP program is broken.  


 Now he ran out of snap and expects to eat here. Like I'm gonna turn away a hungry person? He knows I won't turn him away because I have a heart,  but I'm enabling him. He put me in a catch 22, preying on my weakness.  He's soon to be legally evicted,  as the courts here are finally starting to hear cases again after its ~6 month hiatus. 

Just venting!! But any input is appreciated!"

I and my brothers decided to move out of our parents' home for personal reason. We go to college in the same city where my parents live. We apply for Calfresh and the caseworker continuously made remarks about we could have been lying about moving out since our parents' home is in the same city. We provided proof of income from unemployment, financial aid and also expenses such as rent; however, during the interview, she kept implying we are lying about moving out, and it is weird and unusual to not live with parents, asking about the dependency status on our parents' taxes, etc. She kept saying that I and my brother are so young, only freshmen in college, it would raise a question on the application and our case might get investigated. I am just baffled with the entire interview experience. 

So my question is: is our case really weird and special and worth investigating? Does dependency on parent's tax affect our Calfresh eligibility? Do Calfresh caseworker this hostile towards applicants?

Update: I received a phone call from an investigator this morning. However, I was in class and wasn't able to pick up. Did my case get send to an investigator? I and my brother just moved out and this whole thing gets complicated real fast. I dont want this to affect my family."

Program policy, policy changes, and discussion of impact are totally fine,  as are expressions of concern,  worry,  or frustration. Calling out or generalizing one group or another on a particular side of an issue,  or perceptions of an ideology's support or lack thereof are not okay. 

We want to keep the tone here civil and productive - dragging off-topic generalizations doesn't help, and I think we can all agree that regardless what the national picture looks like over the next eight months, it's going to often be polarizing and ugly. Nobody wins in those discussions.

I realize that there might be variations in the benefits people receive, but in general: 

1. Can food stamps buy toiletries (toothpaste, tampons etc.?)
2. If not, how do most people on public assistance afford these?
3. Can food stamps buy OTC meds such as vitamins?
4. In general, is it cheaper to buy things like vitamins or Tylenol over the counter than it is to get them with a prescription on Medicaid? (Not sure what the average Medicaid co-pay is.)

*I sent documents on Nov 23, 2020

I did not receive any notices or any request for
 any other documents.  Not by mail, not by
 email.

My food benefits are deposited on the 3rd of every month. 
* December 3rd, they were not deposited? 


I called 211Texas, after being on hold for 59 minutes, ( on a pre paid  limited minutes phone)
The person I spoke to said, they didnt get deposited because I have to do an interview,
which is scheduled for Dec 8. 


At the end of July, after weeks of fighting to reinstate my benefits that had been wrongfully suspended in May, HHS agreed that the suspension was an error. But I had to go through the application process anyways, after completing that, and having an interview, my benafits were reinstated, but for only half the amount I had been getting. 
Just grateful for anything.
* Done *


August I moved into a apartment after being homeless, so I had to submit a change. 
I submitted the change, then I had to send lease, bills, income. Hit several bumps in the road, but completed that.
* Done *


November received a notice to renew my Snap and then another notice to renew my Medicaid.
Completed that on Nov 23, but now again bumps in the road.  I dont understand why I would need to renew Snap at this time anyways?
I did the application and interview just 3 months ago, sent all required information.  Then again 2 months ago when reported the move, and update on the new living expenses, sent everything then as well. 


Now, no benefits for December, I will never get back on my feet with these problems with HHS, that result in disconnected utilities, late fees, reconnection fees, or hungry kids. 

Can someone please tell me what if anything I can do? Its only Dec 6, and Im already having to use money that is supposed to  be used on our electric bill on food, so by the next deposit day Jan 3, ( if theres no other problems after doing an interview), I will for sure be behind on rent, and have lost utilities.

We've had a few incidents crop up - last night, most recently - of discussions devolving into political mudslinging. /u/songofstorms and I talked this morning,  and my thought is that,  particularly with the already-early tones of the oncoming political season, /r/foodstamps is a place that needs to be kept free of that sort of thing. 

I strongly suspect that as we get closer to November, even mentioning candidate names, regardless which one,  is going to end up descending into partisan vitriol. I don't think anyone comes off looking good as a result of that,  regardless of where your political leanings lie or how morally right you may or may not be.

I'm suggesting,  therefore,  that as a sub we adopt a strict non-politics rule. This is going to be a little difficult - it is, after all, a government program, but I'm confident we can discuss program specifics or changes without dragging fault or finger-pointing into it. I had thought to go ahead and just do it,  but I think it's always best to get consensus.

Speak up, and let us know what you think.  I'll leave this up and stickied for a few days so people see it."

They had initially said they could only pay 64% of February's food stamps benefit obligations should the shutdown continue into February. 

""The agency initially guaranteed funding for the program, which serves more than 38 million people, only until the end of January if the partial government shutdown isn't resolved sooner.

The department says it is now using a provision allowing it to make obligated payments within 30 days of a government funding lapse, and is working with states to issue February's food stamp benefits -- which are expected to total $4.8 billion -- by January 20.""

I was reciving requests from SNAP well after a month that I had applied, but that I needed to verify some things. By the time I recovered at home to start looking up my bills and see if unemployment had payed me anything yet etc I saw their request in the mail. So I missed their deadline for 5 days.

Now their original request said :

Information/Action Required
Expenses are greater than income. 
Please provide information as to how you 
are paying your bills. 

Acceptable Verification/Proof
You must provide verification of how you are meeting your expenses or proof your expenses are not paid

So I talked to a rep after that, I sent them my missed mortgage house payments, the mortgage is 1141 of the missed payments, but I wrote 1400 in ""shelter costs"" since I was including HOA.

That page says ""Costs that lower your income"" (deductions) 
Cost 1,400.     Deduction. 586

They sent me a new letter saying:

Expenses are greater than income.
Please provide information as to how you are paying your bills. Provide verification of your mortgage payment. 

What changed was the amount in their ""Costs that lower your income""(deductions)

It says now, Shelter 360, deduction 360.

So it seems like they adjusted my shelter costs and now they want to see how the remaining 360 are paid?
Or they want to know how did I afford to pay stuff if my expenses were greater than income?

I thought of sending them the statement where it shows unemployment was paying in December but then they stopped in December, so I then applied to SNAP because I was unsure if I was going to get unemployment back.


What should I do and not do? I am having a very slow recovery from covid, I don't have the energy to be dealing with all the extra stress. I really need the help. Unemployment has paid whenever they want to then stop paying again. 

I am not sure if what I posted make sense. I am just hoping to get advice from people that was in the same situation and how they resolved it. 


Thank you. Please don't let covid get you, it got me almost a year after I took care of myself."

I'm a journalism master's student compiling a thesis on SNAP/P-EBT/EBT in the context of food insecurity in New York City. I'm looking to speak with anyone who has used the program at any point over the past couple of years (ideally I'll speak with people who used it prior to COVID and those who applied after COVID's arrival). I'd love to hear from anyone with intimate experience with the program or knowledge of its operations. I'm looking to better understand the everyday decisions (how accessible is the program, how households choose to use it, do households still look to charitable programs like food banks etc.)

If this is something you're willing to discuss, please reach me by DM and I'll take you through more specifics. Right now, I just want to put the call out there to get a better survey of people's experience with the program.

I do want to emphasize something, so apologies for the length: Food insecurity is not synonymous with poverty nor is poverty synonymous with food insecurity. One of the most destructive narratives that has emerged since the pandemic is that food insecurity is some kind of new phenomenon in the U.S.  I believe too many stories are written about the mere existence of these realities as if they haven't existed before (this speaks to a broader issue about how media organizations are built and how they cover communities unfamiliar to them). 

What is important to me is how people are adapting in these increasingly challenging times and what role government assistance plays in that. If I can promise you anything, it is that I will listen carefully about your experience with the SNAP program and how it factors into your everyday life.

If this interests you, please DM me. I think it's important that the public is better aware of how the SNAP and (P)-EBT programs are designed and how individuals interact with them.

Thank you!"

88,[CA] Need advice re how to come clean - accidentally committed fraud,10,j53uuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/j53uuq/ca_need_advice_re_how_to_come_clean_accidentally/,10,1601865025,"Hi Reddit, I recently discovered that I have accidentally committed fraud by not reporting income and have been pretty stressed. I do intend to ""turn myself in"" and try to come clean but am wondering what's the best way to approach this.

A little background: my spouse worked a minimum wage job in the food industry (no tip position) and her hours varied every week, anywhere from 15-25 hours. I am a contract worker so it's always a famine or feast situation, and needless to say my income fluctuates a lot.

2019 was a very dry year for me, and I only worked a total of 2 months by the time my spouse and I applied for CalFresh for the first time in November 2019. I just took a look at our original application and we put $8K for her yearly income, and $15K for my yearly income. Both numbers were estimates based on our situation at the time.

I am not exactly sure how/why it happened this way but our application was under my spouse's name with her as the main contact. She was the one who got interviewed on the phone and got approved, etc, but I am actually the one handling finance in our household. So here comes the problem - I knew nothing about the program and didn't bother to look into our responsibilities... Soon after we were approved, I actually got another job which lasted till mid December. My spouse's situation stayed the same. The idea of reporting change of income never even crossed our mind.

Fast forward to 2020, my spouse's situation is still more or less the same but I again worked a contract job from Feb to April (did not report), and lost the job due to COVID before I went on unemployment in early April (also did not report).

We received a recertification letter recently and that's when I realized that I should have 1) reported my UI benefit and 2) reported change of income while I had my contract jobs (my income was $0 when we applied for CalFresh). Our 2019 tax filing shows $31K gross income, which is $8K more than the estimate we put in our original application. We obviously are not wealthy and had zero intention to cheat the system but am not sure if they'll believe us.

Our phone interview is scheduled for 2PM on Thursday and I want to be on the phone as well so I can explain the situation as it was only me who had a change of income significant enough to affect our eligibility.

Where do I even start? UI because they certainly see that in their system? What do I even say about my contract jobs and reasons for not reporting them months ago? We stopped using our EBT card immediately after this realization and will fully cooperate to pay back anything we owe. I just don't want this to become a legal/criminal matter and have it on my record.

Last question - we do not want to be considered for renewal. We actually decided to move abroad after the holidays (lots of self reflection during Covid). How do I withdrawal/request for our case to be terminated?

Thank you very much."

SNAP benefits already used in the current month can be replaced by the issuing agency, if you can show that the food purchased with SNAP was lost due to something catastrophic and beyond your control - wildfires, flooding, home fire, hurricanes,  tornadoes,  etc. Agencies differ on what they'll ask for in terms of verification - Oregon historically takes a very lenient view, but other states may do it differently. 

To get this moving,  typically, you would want to make contact with your area's agency, and ask - explain your situation and ask what they'll need.  You'll probably need to know when and where,  and about how much,  you spent to start off with."

1. Upload AND hand deliver requested documents in a timely manner.
2. Make sure you get receipt via screen shot for uploaded documents and a receipt for hand deliveries. 
3. Always remain polite and pleasant, we are all humans and they have difficulties in life as well. You will brighten their day with your optimism.
4. Call and leave a message to your caseworker often. If they haven't contacted you in a few days, call their supervisor. These are need based programs and many people apply so keep contacting them. 
5. Go to the office  or call and confirm that the caseworker is available and see if the receptionist can set up an appointment for you to speak with your caseworker.
6. If you haven't received any letter or phone call, contact the supervisor of the supervisor of your caseworker to let her know what's going on. 
7. I know it can be frustrating because we apply for these benefits because we are in need, but remain polite, friendly and always have proof for any income you receive, so as to not have any delay in benefits.
8. Many times in my area caseworkers make mistakes and close cases, look over your paperwork for any inconsistencies and try to self-edit. If your caseworker states any untrue info regarding what you sent in or that they didn't receive it, kindly inform them of the receipts. Hopefully your case will be re-opened and you get the benefits your family needs Good luck!"
